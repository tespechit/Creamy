<h2>Welcome to Creamy!</h2>
<p>Creamy is a free, open source CRM for managing contacts & customers, lightweight, easy to use and customisable. Creamy is a full-fledged CRM framework that allows you to handle your contacts, customers and clients easily, manage the tasks associated with your business, and be notified of important events. This is a short guide to help you getting started with the main functionality of Creamy. Let's start!</p>

<h3>Users and Permissions</h3>
<p>Creamy is a multi-user CRM. You can have as many users as you need. In order to control what data can be accessed by who, and who can delete, edit or modify the information stored in the system, Creamy implements a role permission scheme, so every user belongs to a certain role category:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Administrators: </strong>Administrators have full control over the system. They are the only ones which can access the admin area, manage the users or modify the settings of Creamy. They also have all the permissions and attributions of the manager role, so they can read, add, modify and delete customers, assign tasks to themselves and others, read the notifications, read, send and receive messages, and access the statistics, among other things.</li>
	<li><strong>Managers: </strong>Managers are top non-admin users in Creamy. They can read, add, modify and delete customers, assign tasks to themselves and others, read the notifications, read, send and receive messages, and access the statistics, among other things.</li>
	<li><strong>Writers: </strong>Writers have writing permissions, but limited to themselves. As they are not managers, they cannot assign tasks to other users, but they can manage, create, delete and modify customers and contacts, and have access to messages and notifications.</li>
	<li><strong>Readers: </strong>Readers are those users who need to query some information from the CRM from time to time, but don't really bother updating the customers and contacts. They have read access to customers and clients, and can access the notifications and messaging system.</li>
	<li><strong>Guests: </strong>Guests don't have any permission on the system. They cannot access any information apart from the main page. They don't have access to customers, contacts, messages or notifications.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Topbar</h3>

<p>The top bar will give you quick access to your messages, notifications and tasks. Each icon has a badge with a number of unread or unattended elements to help you get a quick overview of things that would require your attention.</p>
<ul>
<li>The messages icon shows you your unread messages, and clicking on it will show you them as a list. Select any of the messages to read it directly.</li>
<li>The notifications icon shows you your notifications for today, and clicking on it will show you them as a list.</li>
<li>The tasks icon shows you your unfinished tasks, and clicking on it will show you them in a list.</li>
<li>The user icon at the right, close to your name, will open a menu where you will be able to access or modify your user data, change your password or logout.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sidebar</h3>
<img src="img/sidebar.png" class="left-paragraph-image" width="200">
<p>The sidebar at the left will get you access to the different sections of Creamy. Let's have a look at what you can find there:</p>
<h4 class="fa fa-bar-chart-o"> Home</h4>
<p>The home screen is where we are right now. It's the main page of Creamy. Here you can find some statistics about the progress in the number of customers, contacts and clients, along with a quick access to the messaging system and this tutorial. Any module or plugin can also install some views here for you to see if they want to allow you to access some functionality or give you a quick overview of the data they handle.</p>
<h4 class="fa fa-users"> Contacts and Customers</h4>
<p>These sections contains all the contacts, customers and clients registered in your CRM, grouped by their type. This is the heart of Creamy. If this is the first time you (or someone in your company) is using Creamy, these sections will be empty, so one of the very first things you should do in order to enjoy Creamy is go to these sections and start filling in customers and contacts to feed your database!</p>
<h4 class="fa fa-envelope"> Messages</h4>
<p>In the messages section you can access a messaging system for the users of the CRM. This is an inner communication tool to give you a quick way of sending messages, questions and meeting appointments to other members of your company or business.</p>
<h4 class="fa fa-exclamation"> Notifications</h4>
<p>This section will give you a timeline with information about all the important events that happened today or occurred during the past week, warning you of anything that's worth your attention: new customers, calendar events, and any other issues. You will be able to access more details about the notification with just a click.</p>
<h4 class="fa fa-tasks"> Tasks</h4>
<p>This section helps you to manage your time by registering tasks for your pending activities, meetings and work. You can mark them as completed, edit them, or delete them altogether. If you have manager or admin permissions, you will be able to assign tasks to other users as well.</p>
<h4 class="fa fa-dashboard"> Admin</h4>
<p>The Admin menu is only available to user with administration permissions. In the Admin menu, you will be able to configure every aspect of Creamy, add, remove or modify users, setup modules and adjust the settings of your CRM.</p>
